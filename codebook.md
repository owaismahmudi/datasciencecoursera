# Features selection of the tidy database:

The selected features are derived from the original features defined in the `features_info.txt` file in the original dataset (can be downloaded using this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)).

The variable `activityname` is taken from the file `activity_labels.txt` and merged with the tidy dataset.
