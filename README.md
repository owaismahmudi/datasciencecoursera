# Course Project - Getting & Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The run_analysis.R script was checked and run on RStudio Version 1.0.143 – © 2009-2016 RStudio, Inc. with R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21).

The script performs the tasks in the following order:

1. Downloads the file from the given [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzips the downloaded zipped file
3. Read activity labels from the file activity\_labels.txt
4. Read test dataset excluding the Inertial Signals
5. Read train dataset excluding the Inertial Signals
6. Read the activity names from the description file 'features.txt'
7. Assign descriptive names to the columns in the test and train datasets
8. Extracts the descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset from activity\_labels.txt
9. 



# Tasks: 
Required to submit: 
1. a tidy data set as described , 
2. a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4. a README.md in the repo with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
